 <a href="ridgemult.html">RIDGEMULT</a>  Ridge multiplicity, the number of simultaneous ridges present.
 
    MULT=<a href="ridgemult.html">RIDGEMULT</a>(IR) where IR is a column array index into wavelet ridge
    temporal locations, as output by <a href="ridgewalk.html">RIDGEWALK</a>, returns the number of 
    ridges present at each time, MULT, which is the same size as IR.
 
    Following the convention of <a href="ridgewalk.html">RIDGEWALK</a>, IR may contain multiple ridges,
    which are separated by a NaN at the end of each ridge.
 
    [MULT,ZTOT]=<a href="ridgemult.html">RIDGEMULT</a>(IR,ZHAT), where ZHAT is the estimated signal
    associated with the ridges, returns the total signal ZTOT. All input
    and output arguments are the same size.

    Cell array input
 
    Often one has an array of K different time series, which are grouped 
    into a cell array Z with one times series per cell.  In this case,
    calling <a href="eddyridges.html">EDDYRIDGES</a> leads to output fields with one ridge per cell.  
 
    In the output of <a href="eddyridges.html">EDDYRIDGES</a>, IR is now a cell array of indices into
    time locations, with one ridge per cell, KR denotes  a cell array of
    indices into the K different time series, and ZHAT is a cell array of
    the corresponding estimated signals.
 
    Note that KR will take on one value along the entirety of any ridge.
 
    MULT=RIDGERECON(IR,KR) and [MULT,ZHAT]=RIDGERECON(IR,KR,ZHAT) also 
    work in this case, where not MULT and ZHAT are also cell arrays.
 
    Usage: mult=<a href="ridgemult.html">ridgemult</a>(ir);
           [mult,ztot]=<a href="ridgemult.html">ridgemult</a>(ir,zhat);
           mult=<a href="ridgemult.html">ridgemult</a>(ir,kr);
           [mult,ztot]=<a href="ridgemult.html">ridgemult</a>(ir,kr,zhat);
