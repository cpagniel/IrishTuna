 <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>  Chunks Lagrangian trajectories based on the Coriolis period.
 
    <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a> is used to split float or drifter data into chunks such that
    the length of each chunk is a fixed multiple of one over the mean
    Coriolis frequency. This can be useful in spectral analysis. 
 
    [NUMO,LATO]=<a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(NUM,LAT,P), where NUM and LAT are date number and
    latitude for Lagangian float or drifter data, re-organizes these into 
    chunks such that the average Coriolis frequency f_C in each chunk is at 
    least P times the Rayleigh frequency f_R for that chunk.
 
    The Rayleigh frequency is f_R=2*pi/(DT*N), in units of radians per unit 
    time, where DT is the sample interval and N is the number of samples.
    The Rayleigh frequency decreases as the chunk length increases.
 
    The input fields NUM and LAT may either be numerical arrays, or 
    cell arrays of numerical arrays, e.g. NUM{1}=NUM1, NUM{2}=NUM2, etc.
 
    The output variables NUM and LAT are cell arrays of numerical arrays, 
    with each cell being just long enough such that f_C > P * f_R. 
 
    Trajectories that are not long enough to satisfy this criterion are 
    discarded, as are short residual segments at the end of trajectories.   
 
    Each input trajectory is thus split into zero, one, or more than one
    cells in the output variables.     
 
    <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(...,P,LMIN) additionally specifies a mininum number of points
    LMIN for each chunk.

    Multiple input / output arguments
 
    [NUMO,LATO,Y1,Y2,...,YM]=<a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(NUM,LAT,X1,X2,...XM,P) chunks the M
    input arrays X1, X2,... XM in the same manner, and returns these as Y1,
    Y2,... YM.  The input variables may either all be numerical arrays of 
    all the same size, or cell arrays of numerical arrays. 
 
    In the case of cell array input, some of the XM may be numerical arrays
    of the same length as the cells NUM and LAT.  The corresponding output 
    variable will then also be a numerical array.  An example of such a
    field is the identification number used in FLOATS.MAT and DRIFTERS.MAT. 
 
    <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a> with no output arguments overwrites the original named output
    variables.

    Optional behaviors
 
    By default, any data in short trajectories for which f_C < P * f_R are 
    discarded, as are data segments at the end of the trajectories.  
 
    <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(...,'keep') keeps these instead.  Short trajectories are 
    returned in their own chunks, and leftover segments are appended to 
    the end of the preceding chunk.  
 
    <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(...,'full') instead ensures that the output cells span the 
    full duration of the input fields.  This is done by appending a final 
    cell having f_C > P * f_R, like the others, but that ends at the final
    data point, regardless of the degree of overlap with the previous cell.  
    Data from cells shorter than the specified length are discarded. 
    __________________________________________________________________
    
    Overlap
 
    <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(...,'overlap',PCT) outputs chunks with a percentage PCT 
    overlap.  For example, <a href="trajchunk.html">TRAJCHUNK</a>(...,'overlap',50) outputs chunks that 
    overlap by 50%.  The default behavior gives chunks with no overlap.
